The subject of this book is the introduction of three main risk parameters, i.e. PD, LGD, EAD.
The book should firstly describe these parameters,
explain why their importance has been increasing recently,
present different machine learning techniques for modelling each of those three parameters as well as decompose the whole modelling process,
discuss everyday challenges and issues that each bank faces in each model development phase,
comment on up-to-date regulatory frameworks which supervise and advise banks at the same time and give them instructions to easily overcome these difficulties.

Topics - brainstorming:

1.  The concept of default
2.  Financial crisis and paying more attention to different types of risk and ways to mitigate them
3.  PD, LGD, EAD - introduction, first models (Altman), historical progress, significance
4.  Basel and IFRS 9
5.  Development process of PD models and initial validation
6.  Calibration of PD models
7.  Validation of PD models and implementation
8.  Use of PD models (approval, IRB, IFRS9, ICAAP, ...)
9.  Example - logistic regression
10. Other machine learning techniques
11. Development of LGD and EAD models
